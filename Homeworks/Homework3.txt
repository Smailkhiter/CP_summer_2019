Please extend your previous Tick Tack Toe game program adding:
- reading the board from a CSV file
- optimizing your code so that you can support a board of any given size

Hint:
It will simplify your code if you use 1 and -1 to represent the X and O respectively
and 0 to represent an empty field. In the CSV file you can use X and O
and then replace them with -1,0,1 upon reading the board.
